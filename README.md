# Mosaic Strict RPG Modules
This is a collection of rules modules that follow the [Mosaic Strict] design
principle. The rules in these documents are _not_ complete games, but they rely
on no other mechanics and assume that no particular rules are being used other
than free role play. Their compatibility with any other rules is _not_
guaranteed. In face, I can't promise they work particularly well _with each
other_.
