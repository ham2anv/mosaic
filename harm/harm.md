  characters.

This document presents a system for suffering and tracking harm in tabletop
RPGs. It is _not_ a complete game in itself. In fact, it conforms to the
[Mosaic Strict] design principle: it does not rely on any mechanic or quantified
state of any other game text, and it assumes no other rules are in use other
than free role play. Its compatibility with any other set of mechanics is _not_
guaranteed.

To use these rules, you need the face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) from a
standard poker deck.

## What Is Harm?

Obvious forms of harm include physical injury and emotional trauma. But this
system takes a wider view of harm. **Harm** is any consequence of action that
impedes or disables the character's capacity for further action in some arena.
Suffer enough harm, and a character may be left unable to act at all.

## Suffering Harm

When your character suffers harm, assess how severe the harm is (minor,
moderate, or major) and then select a number of cards at random:

| Minor | Moderate | Major |
|:-----:|:--------:|:-----:|
|   3   |    2     |   1   |

Choose one of the selected cards. The suit of the chosen card determines what
arena of action the harm affects:

- **Clubs** impact the character's ability to physically harm others.
- **Diamonds** affect the character's ability to gather resources, be they
  physical, social, etc.
- **Hearts** limit the character's ability to influence others or understand
  their feelings and motivations.
- **Spades** affect the character's ability to change their physical
  environment.

The rank of the chosen card sets the intensity of the harm:

- A **Jack** _hinders_ the ability, only limiting it in small ways or in narrow
  circumstances.
- A **Queen** _impedes_ the ability, potentially stopping action entirely in
  some circumstances and making it more difficult in others.
- A **King** _disables_ the ability, leaving the character unable to act in that
  arena except in a few specific ways.

If the character attempts an action in an arena marked with harm, consider the
most intense harm when resolving the action.

## Escalating and Resolving Harm

Whenever your character suffers harm, make note of the selected card. If you
select a card (same rank _and_ suit) that you have marked before, treat the new
harm as being one rank higher (Jack -> Queen -> King). If this would step the
card up beyond King, the character suffers a crisis (see [In Crisis] below).

Clear one marked Jack at the end of any scene in which your character is able to
rest and recuperate. (If there's any doubt, don't clear any harm.) If you have
no marked Jacks at the end of a session, step each Queen down to Jack. (These
will recover as described in later sessions.) If you have no Jacks _or_ Queens
at the end of a session, step each King down to Queen.

## In Crisis

A character in crisis is unable to act further in the current scene.
